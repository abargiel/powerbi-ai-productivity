# AI Developer Productivity – Power BI Dashboard (Demo)

## Overview
This repository contains a **demo Power BI dashboard** analyzing how **AI usage, sleep,
cognitive load, and caffeine intake** influence developer productivity and commit performance.

The project was created for **recruitment and portfolio purposes**.  
All data is **fictional or synthetically enriched** and does not represent real individuals or teams.

## Business Problem
Engineering teams often lack clear visibility into how work habits and external factors
affect productivity and well-being.

This analysis aims to identify:
- What drives higher commit productivity
- How sleep, distractions, and caffeine impact cognitive load
- How AI tools influence developer efficiency across seniority levels

---

## Solution
An interactive **Power BI dashboard** with six analytical views:
- **Summary** – high-level productivity overview
- **Coding** – AI usage vs commits (with simulation model)
- **Sleep** – sleep impact on distractions and focus
- **Bugs** – relationship between bugs, sleep, and cognitive load
- **Load** – cognitive load drivers
- **Coffee** – caffeine intake vs productivity and strain

---

## Key Insights
- AI usage strongly increases commit frequency across all seniority levels
- Insufficient sleep and frequent distractions significantly raise cognitive load
- High caffeine intake supports short-term output but reduces long-term performance
- Mid-level developers show the most balanced productivity profile

---

## Tools & Techniques
- Power BI Desktop
- Data modeling (star schema, time-based analysis)
- DAX measures (time intelligence, simulations, custom tooltips)
- Synthetic data enrichment for demo purposes

---

## How to Use
1. Download the `.pbix` file
2. Open it using **Power BI Desktop** (latest version recommended)
3. Use slicers and tooltips to explore relationships and insights
